# beverly-mutuku-projects
Hi, I'm Beverly. I'm a Statistics and Data Science major at Loyola Marymount University (GPA: 3.90). I like exploring data-driven questions that blend tech, health, and real-world problem solving. This repository collects coursework and personal projects using Python and R.

## Projects
- *Cancer Mortality Analysis (R, Multivariable Regression)*  
  Public-health data analysis using regression, feature selection, and model diagnostics to study how
  demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to U.S. county-level cancer mortality rates.

- *Whack-A-Python (Python, OOP + Pygame)*  
  A small Whack-A-Mole–style game built with Pygame using object-oriented design, grid logic, and simple GUI interactions.

More projects coming soon.
