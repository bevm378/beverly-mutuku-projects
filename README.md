# beverly-mutuku-projects
Hi, I'm Beverly. I'm a Statistics and Data Science major at Loyola Marymount University (GPA: 3.90). I enjoy exploring data-driven questions that blend tech, health, and real-world problem solving. This repository showcases some of my coursework and personal projects using Python and R.

## Projects
- *Cancer Mortality Analysis (R, Multivariable Regression)*  
  Public-health data analysis using regression, feature selection, and model diagnostics to explore how
  demographic factors relate to cancer death rates.

- *Whack-A-Python (Python, OOP)*  
  Small “Whack-A-Mole”–style game built with object-oriented programming and basic GUI logic.

More projects (including deep learning work in PyTorch) coming soon.
