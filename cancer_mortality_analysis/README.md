**Highlights so far:**
- Cleaned and merged public health datasets for analysis
- Built multiple regression models with feature selection
- Evaluated model fit and multicollinearity using diagnostics
- Visualized results with ggplot2

*Status:* In progress -- final model evaluation and documentation underway
*Tools:* R, ggplot2, dplyr, car  
*Course:* Multivariable Statistics
